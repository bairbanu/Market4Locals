# Market4Locals

A marketplace that digitizes and incentives 'garage sales' using blockchain. The platform enables buyers/sellers/drivers to create local economies to move physical goods with fluidity. Drivers are incentivized to earn money by delivering goods (much like Lyft / Uber), and sellers can get rid of items they no longer desire and have someone pick it up for them. Buyers can tap their local economy and support their communities.
